## My current work

In **2024** I joined the [University of Southampton](http://southampton.ac.uk) as a [Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/65c5fn/mr-cristian-domarchi). I work in [Survey Futures](https://surveyfutures.net/), a large-scale research project funded by the [UKRI-ESRC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/esrc/). The project involves seven research strands across several organisations (universities, data collection agencies, and consultancy firms, among others), and aims to ensure large-scale social surveys in the UK can innovate and adapt in a changing environment. The challenges of collecting high-quality data have been an ever-present concern throughout my career and I'm proud to be contributing to this highly exciting field of research.

My work in Survey Futures is spread across two research strands:
* [**Research Strand 4** – Surveys without field interviewers](https://surveyfutures.net/research-programme/research-strand-4/), led by [Dr Olga Maslovskaya](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5wzzpw/doctor-olga-maslovskaya) at the [University of Southampton](http://southampton.ac.uk).
* [**Research Strand 5** – Complex measurements](https://surveyfutures.net/research-programme/research-strand-5/), led by [Professor Lisa Calderwood](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/48143-lisa-calderwood) at [University College London](http://ucl.ac.uk).

I also work at the [Training and Capacity Building Stream](https://surveyfutures.net/training-capacity-building/) led by [Professor Gabriele Durrant](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5x25ff/professor-gabriele-durrant) at the [University of Southampton](http://southampton.ac.uk), and [Ms. Debbie Collins](https://natcen.ac.uk/people/debbie-collins) at the [National Centre for Social Research (NatCen)](https://natcen.ac.uk/).

## My previous work

Besides the work derived from my academic studies, which has generated several [publications](/pages/publications.md), I have taken part in various applied research projects, including:

* Discrete choice models for electric vehicle choice in Santiago and Bogota ([Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/es) (**2022–2023**).
* Car ownership and use models of private car choice in three Latin American cities: Santiago, Bogota, and Buenos Aires, working for the [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/es) (**2020–2022**).
* Sample and fieldwork design for a new methodology to measure and estimate fare evasion rates in the public transport system in Santiago, working for [Chile’s Metropolitan Public Transport Directory, DTPM](https://www.dtpm.cl/) (**2018–2019**).
* Discrete choice models estimation and demand forecasting for public transport services in Santiago, in the context of research project “A behavioural planning tool for modelling public transport systems”, FONDEF Project N° D10E1049, directed by [Professor Juan de Dios Ortúzar](https://www.ing.uc.cl/academicos-e-investigadores/juan-de-dios-ortuzar-salas/) at the [Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile](http://www.puc.cl) (**2017-2018**).
