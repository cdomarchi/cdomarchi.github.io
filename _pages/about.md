Hi! I am **Cristian Domarchi** and this is a website for my academic and consulting profiles. 

I was born in Chile and have been living in the UK since 2019. My research focuses on data collection, processing, analysis, and modelling, with a special emphasis on statistical and econometric models as well as survey methodologies. While most of my career has been devoted to transport behaviour modelling, I am also interested in quantitative social research and statistical modelling in general.

I began my education with a Civil Engineer degree (including a major in Transport) from [Universidad de Concepción](http://www.udec.cl) in my hometown  of Concepción, Chile. I then pursued an MSc in Transportation Engineering and Logistics at [Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile](http://www.puc.cl) (PUC) in Santiago, Chile. I completed a PhD in Behaviour Informatics at [Newcastle University](http://ncl.ac.uk) in 2024.

I have a 15-year+ experience in data collection and modelling studies. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Southampton](http://southampton.ac.uk), working in [Survey Futures](https://surveyfutures.net/), a large-scale research project funded by the [UKRI-ESRC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/esrc/), and aiming to ensure large-scale social surveys in the UK can innovate and adapt in a changing environment. [My institutional website](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/65c5fn/mr-cristian-domarchi) provides more information about my current role.
