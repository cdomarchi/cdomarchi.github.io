Hi! My name is **Cristian Domarchi**. I was born in Chile and I'm currently living in the UK. This is a website for my academic and consultancy profiles.

My research interests lie in data collection, processing, analysis, and modelling, with special emphasis on statistical and econometric models, and survey methodologies. While most of my career has been focused in transport behaviour modelling, I am broadly interested in quantitative social research in general.

My formation started as with a Civil Engineer degree (including a major in Transport) from [Universidad de Concepción](http://www.udec.cl) in my hometown (Concepción, Chile). I then did an MSc in Transportation Engineering and Logistics at [Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile](http://www.puc.cl) (PUC) in Santiago, Chile. I completed a PhD in Behaviour Informatics at [Newcastle University](http://ncl.ac.uk) in 2024.

I have a 15-year+ experience as a in  data collection and modelling studies. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Southampton](http://southampton.ac.uk), working in [Survey Futures](https://surveyfutures.net/), a large-scale research project funded by the [UKRI-ESRC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/esrc/), and aiming to ensure large-scale social surveys in the UK can innovate and adapt in a changing environment. [My institutional website](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/65c5fn/mr-cristian-domarchi) provides more information about my current role.
