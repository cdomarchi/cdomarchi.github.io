## My current work

In **2024** I joined the [University of Southampton](http://southampton.ac.uk) as a [Postdoctoral Research Fellow](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/65c5fn/mr-cristian-domarchi). I work in [Survey Futures](https://surveyfutures.net/), a large-scale research project funded by the [UKRI-ESRC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/esrc/). The project involves seven research strands across several organisations (universities, data collection agencies, and consultancy firms, among others), and aims to ensure large-scale social surveys in the UK can innovate and adapt in a changing environment. The challenges of collecting high-quality data have been an ever-present concern throughout my career and I'm proud to be contributing to this highly exciting field of research.

My work in Survey Futures is spread across two research strands:
* [**Research Strand 4** – Surveys without field interviewers](https://surveyfutures.net/research-programme/research-strand-4/), led by [Dr Olga Maslovskaya](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5wzzpw/doctor-olga-maslovskaya) at the [University of Southampton](http://southampton.ac.uk).
* [**Research Strand 5** – Complex measurements](https://surveyfutures.net/research-programme/research-strand-5/), led by [Professor Lisa Calderwood](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/48143-lisa-calderwood) at [University College London](http://ucl.ac.uk).

I also work at the [Training and Capacity Building Stream](https://surveyfutures.net/training-capacity-building/) led by [Professor Gabriele Durrant](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5x25ff/professor-gabriele-durrant) at the [University of Southampton](http://southampton.ac.uk), and [Ms. Debbie Collins](https://natcen.ac.uk/people/debbie-collins) at the [National Centre for Social Research (NatCen)](https://natcen.ac.uk/).

## My previous work

I have been working in consultancy projects for over **17 years** (!).

Since **2019** I assist Professors [Elisabetta Cherchi](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/engineering/staff/profile/elisabettacherchi.html) and [Juan de Dios Ortúzar](https://www.ing.uc.cl/academicos-e-investigadores/juan-de-dios-ortuzar-salas/) in their roles as Co-Editors-in-Chief of [*Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice*](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/transportation-research-part-a-policy-and-practice), one of the leading journals in the transportation field.

I previously worked at [DICTUC](http://www.dictuc.cl), a subsidiary company of [Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile](http://www.puc.cl), from **2007** to **2018**. I took part in several projects, mostly involving transport data collection and analysis, as well as econometric and statistical modelling. 

Finally, since **2018** I have been part of several consultancy and research projects as an independent part-time adviser. I've mainly contributed with modelling and analysis on topics including highway traffic forecasting and transport demand studies in general.

The following is a short summary of the main projects I have worked on throughout the years:

## Surveys and data collection

1. Data collection and choice model estimation to understand the potential demand for electric vehicles in Latin American cities ([Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/es), **2022–2023**).
2. Sample and fieldwork design for a new methodology to measure and estimate fare evasion rates in the public transport system in Santiago ([Chile’s Metropolitan Public Transport Directory, DTPM](https://www.dtpm.cl/), **2018–2019**).
3. Consulting work for several public agencies in Chile, including:
* A detailed study of share taxis operation in the Coquimbo-La Serena conurbation (**2017–2019**).
* Data collection for the environmental modelling of traffic flows for the [Secretary of Transport Planning SECTRA](https://www.sectra.gob.cl/) (**2008**, **2010** and **2016**).
* Traffic flow measurement and demand modelling studies for Chile's [Ministry of Public Works](https://planeamiento.mop.gob.cl/) (MOP, **2010**, **2011**, and **2014**).
* Measurement and analysis of Traffic and public transport variables for the 2012 Origin-Destination Survey ([SECTRA](https://www.sectra.gob.cl/), **2012–2014**).
* The _Key performance indicators of the public transport system in Santiago_, the main source of public transport data for ([DTPM](https://www.dtpm.cl/), (**2007–2012**).
* 16+ studies concerning the measurement and estimation of fare evasion in Santiago’s public transport system ([DTPM](https://www.dtpm.cl/) and other bus operators, **2015–2018**).
* 20+ public transport demand measurement studies in mid-size Chilean cities (**2008–2015**).
* 15+ studies concerning the design and administration of transport surveys in several contexts.

## Transport modelling and forecasting

1. Demand models for electric vehicle choice in Santiago and Bogota ([Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/es), **2022–2023**)
2. Car ownership and use models of private car choice in three Latin American cities: Santiago, Bogota, and Buenos Aires ([Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/es), **2020–2022**).
3. Discrete choice models estimation and demand forecasting for public transport services in Santiago, in the context of research project _A behavioural planning tool for modelling public transport systems_, directed by Prof. Juan de Dios Ortúzar (**2016–2018**).
4. Highway traffic modelling and forecasting for several entities, including:
* Ministerio de Hacienda, Colombia (**2019–2020**).
* Lamsac, Lima, Perú (**2019**).
* Autopista Vespucio Norte, Chile (**2017**).
* Ruta del Canal, Chile (**2017**).
* Abertis Argentina (**2016**).
