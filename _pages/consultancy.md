I have been working in consultancy projects for over **17 years** (!).

Since **2019** I assist Professors [Elisabetta Cherchi](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/engineering/staff/profile/elisabettacherchi.html) and [Juan de Dios Ortúzar](https://www.ing.uc.cl/academicos-e-investigadores/juan-de-dios-ortuzar-salas/) in their roles as Co-Editors-in-Chief of [*Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice*](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/transportation-research-part-a-policy-and-practice), one of the leading journals in the transportation field.

I previously worked at [DICTUC](http://www.dictuc.cl), a subsidiary company of [Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile](http://www.puc.cl), from **2007** to **2018**. I took part in several projects, mostly involving transport data collection and analysis, as well as econometric and statistical modelling. 

Finally, since **2018** I have been part of several consultancy and research projects as an independent part-time adviser. I've mainly contributed with modelling and analysis on topics including highway traffic forecasting and transport demand studies in general.

The following is a short summary of the projects I have worked on throughout the years:

### Surveys and data collection

Consulting work for several public agencies in Chile, including:
* A detailed study of share taxis operation in the Coquimbo-La Serena conurbation (**2017–2019**).
* Data collection for the environmental modelling of traffic flows for the [Secretary of Transport Planning SECTRA](https://www.sectra.gob.cl/) (**2008**, **2010** and **2016**).
* Traffic flow measurement and demand modelling studies for Chile's [Ministry of Public Works](https://planeamiento.mop.gob.cl/) (MOP, **2010**, **2011**, and **2014**).
* Measurement and analysis of Traffic and public transport variables for the 2012 Origin-Destination Survey ([SECTRA](https://www.sectra.gob.cl/), **2012–2014**).
* The _Key performance indicators of the public transport system in Santiago_, the main source of public transport data for ([DTPM](https://www.dtpm.cl/), (**2007–2012**).
* 16+ studies concerning the measurement and estimation of fare evasion in Santiago’s public transport system ([DTPM](https://www.dtpm.cl/) and other bus operators, **2015–2018**).
* 20+ public transport demand measurement studies in mid-size Chilean cities (**2008–2015**).
* 15+ studies concerning the design and administration of transport surveys in several contexts.

### Transport modelling and forecasting

Highway traffic modelling and forecasting for several entities, including:
* Ministerio de Hacienda, Colombia (**2019–2020**).
* Lamsac, Lima, Perú (**2019**).
* Autopista Vespucio Norte, Chile (**2017**).
